## n+1 쿼리의 장단점

```
"n+1" is a database query problem that occurs when an application retrieves a collection of data, 
and then queries the database again for each individual item in the collection. 
This results in "n+1" database queries, where "n" is the number of items in the collection.

Here are some pros and cons of using the "n+1" query approach:

Pros:

Simplicity:
Flexibility: "n+1" queries allow developers to retrieve specific pieces of information without having to retrieve the entire dataset.
Scalability: In some cases, "n+1" queries may be faster and more scalable than more complex queries that involve multiple joins.

Cons:

Performance: "n+1" queries can result in slow performance, particularly when dealing with large datasets. The repeated queries can cause significant delays in the application's response time.
Resource utilization: Repeated queries can put a strain on the database server, especially when the server is handling a large number of concurrent requests.
Maintenance: "n+1" queries can be difficult to maintain and debug, particularly when dealing with complex data relationships. This can make it harder to optimize the queries over time.

Overall, while "n+1" queries may be simple and flexible, they can also be inefficient and resource-intensive. It's important for developers to carefully consider their use of "n+1" queries and optimize their queries as much as possible to avoid performance issues.
    
  
장점:

간단:
유연성: "n+1" 쿼리를 사용하면 개발자가 전체 데이터 세트를 검색하지 않고도 특정 정보를 검색할 수 있습니다.
확장성: 경우에 따라 "n+1" 쿼리는 여러 조인이 포함된 더 복잡한 쿼리보다 더 빠르고 확장 가능할 수 있습니다.

단점:
성능: "n+1" 쿼리는 특히 대규모 데이터 세트를 처리할 때 성능이 저하될 수 있습니다. 반복되는 쿼리로 인해 애플리케이션의 응답 시간이 상당히 지연될 수 있습니다.
리소스 활용: 반복되는 쿼리는 특히 서버가 많은 수의 동시 요청을 처리할 때 데이터베이스 서버에 부담을 줄 수 있습니다.
유지 관리: "n+1" 쿼리는 특히 복잡한 데이터 관계를 처리할 때 유지 관리 및 디버그하기 어려울 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 시간이 지남에 따라 쿼리를 최적화하기가 더 어려워질 수 있습니다.

전반적으로 "n+1" 쿼리는 단순하고 유연할 수 있지만 비효율적이고 리소스를 많이 사용할 수도 있습니다. 
개발자가 "n+1" 쿼리 사용을 신중하게 고려하고 쿼리를 최대한 최적화하여 성능 문제를 방지하는 것이 중요합니다.

# Splitting Methods in Your Code

When writing code, it's important to keep your methods focused and concise. Long, complex methods can be difficult to read and understand, and they can also be more difficult to test and maintain. To help keep your code organized, it's often a good idea to split your methods into smaller, more focused pieces. In this Markdown file, we'll explore some strategies for splitting methods in your code.

## Principles

When splitting methods, there are several key principles to keep in mind:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each method should have a single, well-defined responsibility. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

- **Cohesion**: The code within a method should be highly cohesive, meaning that it's all related to the same purpose.

- **Code Reuse**: Code that can be reused should be factored out into a separate method or utility class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

- **Testability**: Methods should be easy to test in isolation. This means they should have clear input and output and not depend on other parts of the code that are difficult to test.

- **Performance**: Splitting methods can sometimes improve performance by making it easier to optimize specific parts of the code.

- **Readability**: Finally, methods should be named in a way that clearly communicates their purpose, and the code within the method should be easy to read and understand.

## Strategies

There are several strategies for splitting methods that you can use:

- **Extract Method**: If you have a block of code within a method that performs a specific task, you can extract that code into a separate method. This can help make the code more readable and easier to understand.

- **Inline Method**: Conversely, if you have a method that's only called in one place, you can consider inlining it back into the calling method. This can simplify the code and make it easier to follow.

- **Extract Class**: If you have a large, complex class with many methods, you can consider extracting some of those methods into a separate class. This can help break down the complexity of the original class and make it easier to maintain.

- **Template Method**: If you have several methods that perform similar tasks with slight variations, you can use a template method pattern. This involves creating a base class with a skeleton method that calls abstract methods, which can be implemented in derived classes.

- **Strategy Method**: If you have a method that can be implemented in multiple ways, you can use a strategy pattern. This involves creating an interface or abstract class with a method that can be implemented in multiple ways, depending on the needs of the calling code.

## Conclusion

By keeping your methods focused and well-organized, you can create code that's easier to understand, maintain, and test. There are several strategies you can use to split your methods, depending on the needs of your specific codebase. Remember to keep your code cohesive, reusable, and easy to read, and you'll be on your way to writing great software!
